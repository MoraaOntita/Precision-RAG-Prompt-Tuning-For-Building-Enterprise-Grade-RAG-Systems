## Business Need
The project focuses in providing AI-driven solutions for optimizing the use of Language Models (LLMs) in various industries. It aims to revolutionize how businesses interact with LLMs, making the technology more accessible, efficient, and effective. By addressing the challenges of prompt engineering which the project  plays a pivotal role in enhancing decision-making, operational efficiency, and customer experience across various industries. It is designed to cater to the evolving needs of a digitally-driven business landscape, where speed and accuracy are key to staying competitive.

This project focuses on three key services: Automatic Prompt Generation, Automatic Evaluation Data Generation, and Prompt Testing and Ranking.

1. **Automatic Prompt Generation Service:** This service streamlines the process of creating effective prompts, enabling businesses to efficiently utilize LLMs for generating high-quality, relevant content. It significantly reduces the time and expertise required in crafting prompts manually.
2. **Automatic Evaluation Data Generation Service:** PromptlyTech’s service automates the generation of diverse test cases, ensuring comprehensive coverage and identifying potential issues. This enhances the reliability and performance of LLM applications, saving significant time in the QA (Quality Assurance) process.
3. **Prompt Testing and Ranking Service:** PromptlyTech’s service evaluates and ranks different prompts based on effectiveness, helping users to get the desired outcome from LLM. It ensures that chatbots and virtual assistants provide accurate, contextually relevant responses, thereby improving user engagement and satisfaction.

## Tech Stack
